# BrastlewarkApp

## Overview

BrastlewarkApp is an mobile application to Browse "Gnome" an show some characteristic about them.

## Installation

To start the project you have to setup an react-native environment (I use expo), and install the project by using at the root of the project.

```bash
npm or yarn install
```
and after you have to start with :
```bash
npm start
```
to launch the app in an Android or IOS emulator.

## Impression
This is my first time, using React-native solution to create a mobile app.
It's easy to learn but take time to master it.
I do not complete all the recommendations requested to create the application due to the short time available at my disposal.

However I really enjoyed coding this application, and I think I will finish it in my spare time by adding the missing features and new functionality
